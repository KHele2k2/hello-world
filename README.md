# hello-world
A place where I store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

My name is Kevin and I learned about GitHub (more than just hearing the name) through Thomas Friedman's book "Thank You For Being Late: An Optimist's Guide To Thriving In The Age of Accelerations".  I first learned to program using HTML when I was thirteen.  Since I've worked in data development and want to know more about Big Data, AI and Machine Learning.
